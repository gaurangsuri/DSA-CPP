LL is one of the most important data structures
used when data is dynamic in nature
implemented using pointers
WHY linked lists ?
memory management efficiency is much better in linked lists
total cost of accessing/inserting an element in arrays is wayyyy more than linked lists
linked lists is made up of nodes which are collections of values
there are 3 different types of linked lists:-
singly linked lists
doubly linked lists
circular linked lists
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
singly linked lists

first node is called head
last node is called tail
made up of items called nodes
one of which contains the actual data and the other consists of a pointer containing the address of the next node
together these collections of nodes is called a singly linked list
